💡 About This Project
This project marks my journey into web development. While I initially followed a tutorial by CSSnippets on YouTube to understand the fundamentals, I've added my own features and modifications to make it unique, including an enhanced progress tracking system and UI improvements.
Note: The local storage feature is currently under development and will be fully functional soon!
